I am an upcoming graduate at Northern Michigan University with a B.S. in Biology and multiple seasons of field experience, specializing in ecology and natural resource management. I am skilled in outdoor team operations and have years of hands-on experience in botany, invasive species management, habitat restoration, and ecological data collection. Adept at managing adverse field conditions, I am proficient in using technical tools such as ArcGIS and R/RStudio. I am experienced in field safety, plant identification, and conservation techniques. I am eager to transition my skills to wildland fire management and suppression through the Forest Service Wildland Fire Apprentice Program.
