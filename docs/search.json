    "text": "This project explores the historic fire regimes across the U.S. Forest Service’s Region 9, focusing on understanding how ecological processes, like natural fires, have historically shaped forest structure and species distribution in the Midwest and Northeastern U.S. Using GIS and historical biophysical settings (BPS) data from LANDFIRE, I analyzed past fire frequencies, intensities, and patterns to better understand the natural role of fire in these ecosystems. These insights contribute to efforts in restoring forest resilience, guiding sustainable land management, and adapting to changing environmental conditions.\nThis project has been instrumental in advancing my technical skills with ArcGIS Pro, a powerful tool widely used in natural resources management. I’ve gained hands-on experience with complex geospatial data analysis, including raster data manipulation and symbology techniques crucial for communicating spatial information. This experience has not only deepened my understanding of ecological processes but also enhanced my ability to apply GIS technology to real-world conservation and land management challenges.\nFind more information about LANDFIRE here."

    "text": "Marquette, Michigan\nAs an Invasive Species Field Technician for the Marquette County Conservation District, I worked to protect vital ecosystems in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula by managing invasive plant populations across federal, state, and private lands. I conducted extensive surveys, both on foot and by vehicle, covering diverse landscapes like the Hiawatha National Forest, Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, and Seney National Wildlife Refuge.\nUsing ArcGIS Field Maps, I accurately mapped invasive species occurrences in the Lake to Lake CISMA area, providing essential data to support local conservation efforts. I developed and executed self-directed daily plans, coordinating with field crews to ensure efficient and effective plant removal and habitat restoration.\nNotably, I contributed to habitat restoration efforts for the federally threatened Dwarf lake iris (Iris lacustris), reinforcing my commitment to preserving biodiversity. My role also involved continual learning and professional development, including attending regional training and field trips through the Michigan Invasive Species Coalition"

    "text": "McCall, Idaho\nAs a Botany Technician Intern with the Payette National Forest, I led and participated in extended field survey trips, working closely with a small team to conduct surveys that support sustainable land management. My role involved conducting rare and sensitive plant surveys to assess potential impacts of management activities, such as timber sales, hazardous fuel reduction, and road decommissioning projects. I documented understory and overstory plant species, using dichotomous keys and USDA plant codes to build accurate species inventories, and I also collected and prepared herbarium specimens for long-term reference.\nI contributed to the conservation of sensitive species, including whitebark pine, by gathering critical spatial and statistical data with ArcGIS Field Maps, and I played an active role in developing a standardized data collection protocol for whitebark pine in collaboration with the USFS Region 4 Ecologist and Silviculturist, as well as the Rocky Mountain Research Station. Through this role, I honed my plant identification and field survey skills, while supporting meaningful conservation and habitat management work within the National Forest system."

I am skilled in outdoor team operations and have years of hands-on experience in botany, invasive species management, habitat restoration, and ecological data collection. Adept at managing adverse field conditions, I am proficient in using technical tools such as ArcGIS and R/RStudio. I am experienced in field safety, plant identification, and conservation techniques. I am eager to transition my skills to wildland fire management and suppression through the Forest Service Wildland Fire Apprentice Program."
