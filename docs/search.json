I conducted extensive surveys, both on foot and by vehicle, covering diverse landscapes like the Hiawatha National Forest, Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, and Seney National Wildlife Refuge.\nUsing ArcGIS Field Maps, I mapped invasive species occurrences in the Lake to Lake CISMA area, providing essential data to support local conservation efforts and inform future management strategies. I developed and executed self-directed daily plans, coordinating with field crews to ensure efficient and effective plant removal and habitat restoration.\nDuring my time with the Marquette County Conservation District, I contributed to habitat restoration efforts for the federally threatened Dwarf lake iris (Iris lacustris), reinforcing my commitment to preserving biodiversity. My role also involved continual learning and professional development, including attending regional CISMA training for the identification of Himalayan Balsam and European Frog Bit, as well as the 2023 Michigan Invasive Species Coalition summer field trip hosted by Lake to Lake CISMA.\n\n\n\nMarquette County Conservation District"

My role involved conducting threatened and endangered species (TESP) surveys to assess potential impacts of management activities, such as timber sales, hazardous fuel reduction, and road decommissioning projects. I documented understory and overstory plant species, using dichotomous keys and USDA plant codes to build accurate species inventories, and I also collected, prepared, and mounted herbarium specimens for long-term reference.\nI contributed to the conservation of sensitive species, including whitebark pine, by gathering critical spatial and statistical data with ArcGIS Field Maps, and I played an active role in developing a standardized data collection protocol for whitebark pine in collaboration with the USFS Region 4 Ecologist and Silviculturist, as well as the Rocky Mountain Research Station. Through this role, I honed my plant identification and field survey skills, while supporting meaningful conservation and habitat management work within the National Forest system.\n\n\n\nPayette National Forest"

    "text": "This project explores the historic fire regimes across the U.S. Forest Service’s Region 9, focusing on understanding how ecological processes, like natural fires, have historically shaped forest structure and species distribution in the Midwest and Northeastern U.S. Using GIS and historical biophysical settings (BPS) data from LANDFIRE, I analyzed past fire frequencies, intensities, and patterns to better understand the natural role of fire in these ecosystems. These insights contribute to efforts in restoring forest resilience, guiding sustainable land management, and adapting to changing environmental conditions.\nThis project has been instrumental in advancing my technical skills with ArcGIS Pro, a powerful tool widely used in natural resources management. I’ve gained hands-on experience with complex geospatial data analysis, including raster data manipulation and symbology techniques crucial for communicating spatial information. This experience has not only deepened my understanding of ecological processes but also enhanced my ability to apply GIS technology to real-world conservation and land management challenges.\nFind more information about LANDFIRE here."
